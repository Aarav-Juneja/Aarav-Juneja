ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aarav Juneja. I mainly know web development, but also know a bit of React Native.  
I have learned many lanugages, but am most familiar with:
- Node.js with express for a server
- Mongodb with mongoose for the database
- Standard HTML, CSS, and JS also knowing about service workers and other features

ðŸŒ± Currently I am focusing on CS50AI and some other projects.
I have finished CS50 from Harvard and [a web development course](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/the-complete-web-development-course)

I also have the domain http://aaravjuneja.com for future projects.
